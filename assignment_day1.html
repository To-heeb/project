<h1 color="white" align="center"><u>WELCOME TO MY WEBPAGE</u></h1>
<p color="white" align="center">This is a webpage that contains the implementation of things I learnt from Moat Academy on the first day(Day1) which includes categories of software and types of application software , how the web works from then client side through the ISP to the server side and back, anatomy of a webpage, elements, inline tags with block tags and the difference between them, heading tags with various other tags and attributes.</p>
<h2 align="center"><u>How I got to know about Moat Academy</u></h2>
<p align="center">I was interested in learning software development since the beginnig of the year but I was too busy with school, after completing my programme I saw it as an opportunity to seek a place to learn before going for service. I search on google "Where to learn programming in Ikeja" because I needed a place close to my house, I saw a few options but the reviews of Moat Academy stood out and they were the best in responding to messages and communication.</p>
<h2 align="center" id="about"><u>ABOUT ME</u></h2>
